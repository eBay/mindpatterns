<h1>Accessibility Patterns for the Web</h1>

<p>This site contains all working examples for the book <cite><a href="https://ebay.gitbooks.io/mindpatterns/content/">eBay MIND Patterns - Accessibility Patterns for the Web</a></cite>.</p>
<p>Each example demonstrates our recommended semantic markup, keyboard interaction design and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a> roles, states &amp; properties for assistive technology.</p>
<p>Each pattern follows a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement</a> strategy (where applicable) and aims to conform to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0</a> Level AA.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>These patterns will assist the frontend developer with accessibility, but are not considered to be final, packaged code.</p>
<p>All patterns leave additional steps to complete. This typically means any CSS styling and JavaScript behaviour that is <em>not</em> specifically related to core functionality or accessibility.</p>
<!--<p>If you'll forgive the wartime analogy, the aim is to get the developer out of the trenches fully equipped, prepared, and in the right state of mind for their next battle! But honestly, it's a lot of fun too (accessibility I mean, not war).</p>-->

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Accessibility testing is performed with latest versions of:
<ul>
    <li>Internet Explorer &amp; JAWS</li>
    <li>Safari &amp; VoiceOver</li>
    <li>Firefox &amp; NVDA</li>
    <li>Chrome &amp; Chromevox</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Support for Internet Explorer 10 and below was recently dropped, allowing us more time to focus on accessibility matters, rather than cross-browser issues.</p>
